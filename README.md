# hacking-scripts

These are a collection of some python scripts for testing the knowledge of python, networking and ethical hacking. I added comments wherever I thought necessary to aid the understanding of the script. Otherwise the scripts follow some basic concepts of python. 

It primarily utilises the scapy library which is supported in python2. I need help in taking it up a notch to python3 for added support.
